### What I learned

Using _filter_ to change the color of an image, like so;

```css
img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    /*Changing the color of the image*/
    filter: opacity(0.6) drop-shadow(0 0 0 hsl(277, 64%, 61%));
}
```
**It turns out it doesn't work in Mozila Firefox**

### Continued development

I plan on learning more on css properties to produce sleeker designs in future projects.

**Note:** I will be redesigning these challenges with **Figma** check them out on my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/OmarCypha) page.
